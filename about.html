        </div>

        <div class="about-section">
            <p><strong>A small game that collapsed into existence.</strong></p>

            <p>Ground State began as a response to a very serious problem: someone, somewhere, was trying to think about physics… and an ad popped up.</p>

            <p>This is a word game about sorting physics terms into the places where they feel most at rest. No explosions, no leaderboards, no artificial urgency. Just concepts gently finding where they belong.</p>

            <p>The name comes from physics itself. The <em>ground state</em> is the lowest energy configuration of a system — not excited, not dramatic, just stable. Anyone who has stared at a problem set long enough has probably entered it by accident.</p>

            <p>Here, words do the same thing. They wander around, bump into the wrong places, and eventually settle into their proper categories. When that happens, the system gets a little quieter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Why It’s Free</h2>
            <p>Ads increase energy. This game is trying to minimize it.</p>

            <p>Ground State is meant to be played slowly, without interruptions, and without anything flashing at you asking for attention. Charging money or injecting ads felt like exciting the system for no good reason.</p>

            <p>So it’s free. As nature intended.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>For Teachers</h2>
            <p>This game is classroom-safe by design.</p>

            <p>Use it, share it, project it, or let students play with it quietly while pretending to review for a quiz. There are no hidden mechanics, no dark patterns, and no permissions required.</p>

            <p>If it helps even one student feel less intimidated by physics vocabulary, it’s doing its job.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Open Source</h2>
            <p>Ground State is open source under the MIT license.</p>

            <p>Fork it. Break it. Turn it into chemistry, biology, linguistics, or something no one has formally named yet. Learning tools should be allowed to escape their original containers.</p>

            <p>Entropy will handle the rest.</p>
